By choosing the right tactics you can advance as far as possible in the game, here are some tips:
<br>● Try to throw identical fruits on top of each other so that they merge immediately.
<br>● Think about where you will put the fruit. Try not to leave small fruits under large ones, as they will be more difficult to merge later.
<br>● Try to do combos. A combo is when you combine two or more fruits at the same time. This will give you a higher score than combining the fruits individually.
<br>● Try to practice the game more often. The more you play Suika Game, the better your skills will improve.
